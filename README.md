This is a puzzle/stealth 2D top-down game developed by 3 students for a university class. Done in 2018 using Unity 2018.2 and later updated to 2020.3. The first stage of the game focus on stealth mechanics, so don't let enemies see you(it's game over if it happens). There is a second stage with some puzzles, so you'll need to work out some paths till you find the right one. The game objective is to pass through the stage and find the safe tent.
